# Implementation of common data structures and algorithms in the C++ language.

## I plan on implementing the following data structures:
- Dynamic Array
- LinkedList
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- Hash Table
- Binary Heap
- Fibonacci Heap
- Undirected & Directed Graphs
- vEB Tree
- DSU (disjoin-set union)
- Segment Tree
- Trie

## I hope to cover the following algorithms
- Sorting (slow algorithms, efficient algorithms, and sorting in linear time with radix, bucket, etc)
- Searching (on arrays + graphs, BFS and DFS)
- Shortest path (dijkstra, 
- How to detect if a graph has cycles? Strongly connected components?
- Topological sorting
- DP matrix multiplication, longest common subsequence
- String matching in O(n)
- Manacher's algorithm
